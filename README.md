# whack-a-mole
In this lab, we created multiple modules to successfully implement a functioning game of “Whack-a-mole” on an FPGA board. We used the 7-segment display in order to display the target number and our stopwatch. Additionally, we used an accessory pmod SSd attachment that displayed the points accumulated by the player.
